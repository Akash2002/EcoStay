# EcoStay
An ecotourism housing platform to support the environment while encouraging tourists!

### Problem
----------
Tourism is one of the most profitable markets in our contemporary world. A lot of people spend time in fancy and grand hotels that don't prioritize preserving the nature and using sustainable energy. Airbnb is one of the most popular platforms for booking places of stay for tourism and it does not place emphasis on ecotourist places of stay. 

### Solution
-----------
I decided to build a platform exclusively for ecotourism similar to that of Airbnb but which places emphasis on ecotourism and ecotourism only. Through this platform, people will be able to book places of stay that support nature, helping them appreciate the beauty of our Earth while also preserving our natural resources. I built this application on the iOS platform using Swift and Google Cloud Firebase services, while my friend helped out with Android.
